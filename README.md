# AIEvolutionaryAlgorithm
 
This program was created for an assignment on Games & Agents. This project was created by three students. One student focused on setting up the Agents, another on creating the GUI, while I focused on creating the evolutionary algorithm and intergrating their evolved "brains" into the Agent's AI system. I worked on GeneticAlgorithm and NeuralNetwork, as well as the fitness function, found in overmindfitnessfunctor.cpp in GNA. The agents performed well enough to complete the assignment, but more time tweaking with the fitness function (Therefore making more precise assessments on how well an agent is performing the task) could improve the agent's performance.
